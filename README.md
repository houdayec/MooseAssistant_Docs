What is it ?
-----------

MOOSE is an application developed to help students coming in Finland. Most of the time, it’s hard to find all what they need at the same place. They rather have to visit multiple websites to get a piece of information each time (rent, university, courses …). So we decided to concentrate all the most important content in one application, and give access to unique features as well. This application was developed by exchange students, so we tried to make the content the most accurate and relevant as possible.
